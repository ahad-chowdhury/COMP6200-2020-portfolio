    "1. Remove rides with no measured power (where device_watts is False) - these are commutes or MTB rides\n",
    "* Look at the distributions of some key variables: time, distance, average speed, average power, TSS. Are they normally distributed? Skewed? \n",
    "* Explore the relationships between the following variables. Are any of them corrolated with each other (do they vary together in a predictable way)? Can you explain any relationships you observe?  \n",

    "* Some of the rides are designated as \"Race\" in the `workout_type` field, these are where I am racing and you might expect that these would be the most challenging rides.  Normalised Power (NP) is a good measure of how hard a ride is.  Explore the values of `NP` for races vs the overall set of rides to see if this hypothesis is supported (use graphs and summary statistics).  Are races more challenging than rides in general? \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is useful to see a summary of rides over the year. Generate a plot that summarises the number of km ridden each month over the period of the data. Overlay this with the _sum_ of the Training Stress Score and the _average_ of the Average Speed to generate an overall summary of activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: to generate these summary plots you need to use the [timeseries/date functionality](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html) in Pandas to generate a new data frame containing the required data.  \n",

    "* What leads to more `kudos`? Is there anything to indicate which rides are more popular? Explore the relationship between the main variables and kudos. Show a plot and comment on any relationship you observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate another summary graph but one that shows the activity over a given month, with the sum of the values for each day of the month shown.  So, if there are two rides on a given day, the graph should show the sum of the distances etc for these rides.\n",
